## Insert Witty Git Pun Here

I started off with [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/) a few years ago, having no idea what I was doing (and arguably better now). At the time I only dabbled with it on a few small things I was doing at work. Even then, I know I wasn't using it the "right" way but it at least gave me a starting point to keep history on what I was working on at the time.

After a while of using it on my local system and servers at work, I wanted to try pushing out to a remote service. My first try was with [GitHub](https://github.com/) - I had an account to track projects I liked. I had used for a tutorial back in 2012 (try_git, no files left though); the only other repo on my account was what I was going to use to run this site. I liked Jekyll enough, but I wanted to keep the repo itself private because I wanted drafts and notes to myself as part of the repo. Ok, I also didn't want to pay for it since I was testing it out...

Enter [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/). Nice interface, easy to use and navigate, free private repos? Sold. Created an account, set up my SSH keys after going though some intro stuff, and pushed to a new remote.

I was also able to set up my site as a private repo but publish it using the CI tools on GitLab. The documentation was great and helped me get up and running in no time. All that was really left to do was create the content. At one point I was going to move the old content over but thought that a fresh start was needed. That might change some day but for now it's staying like this.

(Note: I wrote the first draft of this before GitHub opened up free private repos)
