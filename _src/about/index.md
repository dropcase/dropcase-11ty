# Off the top of my head

I've used `dropcase` as my online name since 2003.

Geek, family, beard, and more ways to show who I am. I am a person who enjoys technology, as well as being in nature.

I like bullet points, especially my own.

I like being able to connect - well, just about anything. People, ideas, systems, patterns, all of it.

Being a whole and healthy person takes a __lot__ of work. Maybe I'll get there someday.
