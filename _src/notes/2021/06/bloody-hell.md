So far I've been learning about how Eleventy works, and I like it. Straightforward, pretty much javascript-driven Static Site Generator (SSG). My workflow to get new pages needs some attention, but there's plenty I have to talk about.

Quick intro to [WAIWO] - What Am I Working On, the process I've been using to attempt to keep track of the things I'm interested in. Sometimes I remember and try to look at it to stay on track. Most of the time it's more like "oh yeah shit I should use that again" (ugh). I guess OYSISUTA helps with WAIWO.

High-level list:
- Outdoor stuff (living in the Northeast US)
- Indoor stuff
  - Cards, board games, knitting, crochet
- Virtual Stuff
  - Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)
  - uh, this site?

Might come back and link things when I have more added to the site, but for now I'll just leave the list there.
