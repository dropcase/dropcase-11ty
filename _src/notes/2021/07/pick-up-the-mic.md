# The Tone, The Timbre

I've wanted to do voiceover work for years. There's always been something else keeping me from trying it - well, at least from sharing anything. Now that I have some decent equipment and can make time for it, let's do this.

Once this starts up, I'll post notes with the raw audio and the post-production version (with credit to anyone else who was involved).

I'll add the link once the page is ready to share (possibly by removing this line).
