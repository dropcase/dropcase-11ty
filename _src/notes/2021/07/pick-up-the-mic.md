# The Tone, The Timbre

I've wanted to do voiceover work for years. There's always been something else keeping me from trying it - well, at least from sharing anything. Now that I have some decent equipment and can make time for it, let's do this.

Once this starts up, I'll eventually post notes with examples of the raw audio and the post-production version (with credit to anyone else who was involved).

I'll add the link once the page is ready to share (possibly by removing this line).

Next steps will happen once I have my own room to record in (aka my office).
